CSS Assignment: Style Your Personal Blog Website

This repository contains the code for my assignment where I created a single-page blog website using only CSS for styling. The website is designed to be interactive using animations and transitions, and it is responsive to ensure compatibility with mobile devices.

## Features


Single Page Layout: The website is designed as a single-page application, allowing users to navigate through different sections seamlessly.
CSS Styling: All styling is done using CSS, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks.

Animations and Transitions: Interactive elements on the website are enhanced with animations and transitions to provide a smooth user experience.

Responsive Design: The website layout is responsive and optimized for viewing on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Challenges Faced

Responsive Design: Ensuring that the website layout looks good and functions properly on different screen sizes posed a significant challenge. This involved utilizing CSS media queries to adjust styles based on screen width.

Animations: Implementing animations and transitions while maintaining responsive design on both desktop and mobile devices required careful consideration of CSS properties and techniques.

## Design Choices

Color Scheme: I opted for a slightly colorful design and modern color scheme with a combination of colorful and dark shades to create visual contrast and hierarchy.

Typography: I used custom fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the website:
  - For headings and titles, I used the [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) font.
  - For body text and paragraphs, I used the [Rajdhani](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rajdhani) font.
  - For special accents or decorative elements, I used the [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script) font.

Layout: The layout of the website is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on delivering content effectively. I utilized a flexbox to achieve responsive and flexible layout structures.

Animations: I used simple animations and transitions to enhance user interaction and engagement. These animations are designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive, providing visual feedback without causing distraction.
